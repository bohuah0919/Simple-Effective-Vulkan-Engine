# Description
The code in this repositorie is extented from Vulkan Guide (https://vkguide.dev/).

My work is adding the code for being able to render a 3d model from online resource.
Additionaly, I implement geometric buffer pipeline, screen space reflection, 
Percentage-Closer Soft Shadows, simple shadow map, and frustum culling based on compute shader.

# Prerequisites
This project uses Vulkan, GLFW, vk-bootstrap, vulkan-memory-allocator, and glm.
