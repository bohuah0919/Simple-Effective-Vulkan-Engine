# Description
The code in this repositorie is extented from Vulkan Guide (https://vkguide.dev/).
It also include code from "https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/tree/master".

My work is adding the code for being able to render a 3d model from online resource.
Additionaly, I implement Multi-Sampling Anti-Aliasing, Cascade shadow Map,
Percentage-Closer Soft Shadows, and Frustum culling based on compute shader.

# Prerequisites
This project uses Vulkan, GLFW, vk-bootstrap, vulkan-memory-allocator, and glm.
